# AC Export Diversion controller
This device allows the controlled energy diversion into a resistive load.
Its purpose is to utilise otherwise exported solar energy by dumping it into a hot water cylinder.
Because the amount of exported solar energy varies, the amount of being diverted into the HWC must also vary.

== WARNING ==

This project deals with high voltage, high current AC electricity. Do not attempt to replicate unless you know what you are doing.

## Alternative
There is an off the shelf device that seem to do the same thing as this project. 

I have not tested this device, it might be a good alternative for some people: [3kw Solar Immersion Controller Power Distributor](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_De9Gy9j)


## Hardware
* [ESP32-C3 SuperMini Dev Board](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEkIgvN)
* [MCP4725 I2C DAC](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dd37UpH)
* [30A Relay Module 5V](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DFhWROL)
* [3.3V/5V Logic Level Converter](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dkny60b)
* [SCR Regulator 120A](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DmAf18X)
* [SSR Heat Sink DIN Rail Mount](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DnF24jp)

## Additional hardware
A way to measure the amount of exported energy is required and must be integrated ito Home Assistant.
I use one of these, and would recommend as it runs EspHome, has plenty of sensor inputs and has been very reliable.
* [Expandable 6 Channel ESP32 Energy Meter](https://circuitsetup.us/product/expandable-6-channel-esp32-energy-meter/?v=8e3eb2c69a18)

## Installation
Install [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/guides/installing_esphome.html)

Create a ```secrets.yaml``` file and add your Wi-Fi credentials in this format

wifi_ssid: '<SSID>'
wifi_password: '<PASSWORD>'


Then run: ```esphome run usb-relay.yaml```

## Example Home Assistant Automation
This example automation which continually adjusts the power going to the hot water cylinder element (fan.hwc_controller) based on the amount of power being exported (sensor.emoncms_grid_consumption)

The target export power has been set to 100W as an attempt to avoid overshot and inadvertent power import under certain weather conditions (i.e. frequent, intermittent cloud coverage)

It also increases/decreases in varying increments based on the amount of import/exported power
